Hi there reader! Thanks for stopping by.  This website will continually be a work in progress. I'm planning to post some projects, instructions, and other tidbits that I've wanted to see or link to those I've used in my own journey.  The posts will likely center on R, Shiny, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Github, and other technical topics related to data science, but may also veer toward substantive topics like demography.  

Thanks for checking in and check back soon!
